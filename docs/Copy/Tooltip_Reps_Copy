Reps & RIR
A rep—repetition—is one complete movement. RIR means reps in reserve: how many more you could do with perfect form before failure.

Here's How It Works:
"8-12 reps at RIR 2" means pick a weight where rep 10 feels hard, rep 11 is difficult, and rep 12 would cause form failure. Stop at 10. Those 2 reps you could've done? That's RIR 2.

The RIR Scale:
RIR 0 = Complete failure, can't do another rep RIR 2-3 = Your sweet spot for most training RIR 4+ = Too easy to build muscle, but great for maintaining. 

Why Leave Reps in the Tank?
Your CNS—central nervous system—processes all stress identically, whether from training or daily life. Research shows training to RIR 0 vs. RIR 2 produces nearly identical muscle growth, but RIR 0 generates significantly more systemic fatigue that persists for days. This accumulated fatigue reduces your performance in subsequent sessions, ultimately limiting your total training volume, the primary driver of adaptation.

Week 1, Set Calibration Set (in bold red in this color hex code: #E85C4A)

First set of Week 1 only (in bold)

Step 1: Do your warm-up sets (required)Step 2: Work up to a weight you can do for 10 perfect repsStep 3: Lift until your form breaks — then stop (“form failure”)
What's different about this set?
* Go to complete failure - can't do another rep (RIR 0)
* All other sets: Save 3 reps in the tank (RIR 3)
